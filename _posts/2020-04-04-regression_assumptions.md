Regression Assumptions
======================

### 1. Linearity (Correct functional form written as a linear equation)

-   A regression model is linear and additive in terms of coefficients.
-   If functional form is incorrect, both the coefficients and standard
    errors in my output are unreliable.
-   How to detect?
    -   Draw a residual plots
    -   Likelihood ratio (LR) test
-   Remedies?
    -   Trial and error
    -   Add higher order of variables to the model. (Watch out p-hacking
        or overfitting!)
    -   Compare the goodness-of-fit of each model.

### 2. Constant Error Variance (Homoskedasticity)

-   In some models, as X increses, the variance of the error term also
    increases. (Heteroskedasticity) ![Heteroskedasticity](hetero.png)

    [***zedstatistics***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFpOQRY0rw)*

-   Under heteroskedasticity, standard errors in output cannot be relied
    upon. (Our coefficients are still unbiased.)

-   How to detect?

    -   Goldfeldt-Quant test
    -   Breusch-Pagan test

-   Remedies?

    -   White’s standard errors (Robust standard errors): Using this,
        our SE slightly increases.
    -   Weighted least squares
    -   Apply log to both x and y

### 3. Independent Error Terms

-   An error term is not dependent on the error prior or next to
    itself.(No autocorrelation.)
    -   If there’s an autocorrelation issue and I know one residual, I
        can guess the next residual based on this observed residual.
        ![Autocorrelation](autocor.png) *source:
        [***zedstatistics***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFpOQRY0rw)*
-   Under autocorrelation, standard errors in output cannot be relied
    upon. (The estimated coefficients are still unbiased, but any
    inferences based on the SE such as confidence interval can be
    controversial.)
-   Usully occured in time-series data.
-   How to detect?
    -   Durbin-Watson test (detecting autocorrelation for the first
        order)
    -   Breusch-Godfrey test
-   Remedies?
    -   Investigate omitted variables
    -   Generalised difference equation (Cochrane-Orchutt or AR methods)

### 4. Normal errors

-   Points should be centered around the fitted line. ![Normality of
    errors](normality.png) *source:
    [***zedstatistics***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MFpOQRY0rw)*
-   If normality is violated and n is small, standard errors in output
    are affected.
    -   In fact, this assumption is a somehow weak assumption, so with a
        large number of observations, the central limit theorem (CLT)
        can be applied and a true relationship can be drawn.
-   How to detect?
    -   Histogram of residuals or QQ plot
    -   Shapiro-Wilk test
    -   Komolgorov-Smirnov test
    -   Anderson-Darling test
-   Remedies?
    -   Change functional form (e.g. log)

### 5. No Multi-collinearity

-   Explanatory variables are dependent each other **to a large
    extent**.
-   Coefficients and standard errors of affected variables are
    unreliable.
-   How to detect?
    -   Look at correlation between X variables
    -   Investigate Variance inflation factors (VIF): Compare the
        variances of two models one of which include a particular
        variable and the other model don’t. When the variable is
        included in the model, if the variance of the model rapidly
        incerases, there might be a multi-collinearity issue.
-   Remedies?
    -   Remove one of the variables.

### 6. Exogeneity (no omitted variable bias)

-   If there is a hidden variable pulling the string of the relationship
    between my X and Y, it could cause omitted variable bias.
-   The hidden variable would affect *ε*<sub>*i*</sub> in the model,
    thus my X is no longer wholly exogenous (or no longer wholly
    determined from outside the model) as it can be explained in part by
    the error term (endogeneity).
-   With this issue, my model can only be used for predictive purposes
    (cannot infer causation ).
-   How to detect?
    -   Intuition
    -   Checking correlations
-   Remedy?
    -   Use instrumental variables (IVs)
    -   Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (if possible)
